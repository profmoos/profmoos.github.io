I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](http://www.umass.edu/economics/) and an Economist at the [Political Economy Research Institute (PERI)](https://www.peri.umass.edu/). I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from the [New School for Social Research](http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/economics/). I study feminist political economy and the welfare state. Prior to beginning my graduate education, I worked for a number of nonprofit advocacy organizations focused on domestic poverty and the U.S. social safety net.
