### Research Interests

My current research focuses on feminist political economy and the welfare state. I am particularly interested in the social processes and institutions necessary for the daily and generational replenishment of the population - particularly the working-class labor force. From the perspective of classical political economy, human labor is the source of society's wealth and the basis of productive growth in any economy. The feminist critique of the classical political economists is that labor is itself produced - or "socially reproduced" - primarily through non-monetary investments into the development and nurturance of human capabilities. As an institutionalist economist, I am particularly interested in how and when states intervene to address real or perceived conflicts between social reproduction and capital accumulation. My research explores this question through a variety of political economy methods: historical case studies, institutional analysis, as well the application of quantitative methods.
